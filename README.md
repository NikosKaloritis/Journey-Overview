# My Journey 

Hello! I am Nikos and this is part of my journey and i have a B.Sc in Computer Science.
I believe to be language agnostic with more knowledge in the set of low level languages.
I have a great interest in computer graphics, math, both pure and applied, 
low level technologies always actively discovering new skills. 

My hobbies âž½ playing musical instruments, solving puzzles and stargazing!

Currently, in my free time, i am working on my Vulkan game engine in (modern)C++
and some small arduino projects and mo.

# iPRISM Research group: Museum of Karditsa - Virutal Reality Meuseum  (2023 - present)

Collaborated with the Meuseum of Karditsa to create an interactive website 
for online visitors and enthusiasts about the exhibits of 1821's Greek War of Indepedance. 
There are three parts of the project, a (2D)two-dimensional and (3D)three-dimentional version, 
as well as a database system used by a network of museums (as well as the websites).

iPRISM Research group: Port a Cath Training VR (2023 - 2024)


Developed and published a virtual reality simulator for the placement 
of port-a-cath devices in cancer patients by surgeons and medical assistants. 
The goal is the ability of training medical personnel through VR technologies
minimizing medical errors that will have negative impact on patients.

# B.Sc Thesis

My university thesis titled 'Development of an Augmented Reality System for Indoor Navigation Assistance'.
A free large scale mobile AR map navigation system for all students to walk through university without the use of internet
beacons/triangulation. Providing information about classes and the space around the user, use of voice navigation, animations
qr repositioning and more.


Due to covid-19 restriction rules the application scaled to a smaller one:
