# My Journey 

Hello! I'm Nikos Kaloritis, and this is a snapshot of my journey.
With a B.Sc in Computer Science in hand, and a language-agnostic approach, 
I'm always exploring new realms of knowledge, from computer graphics and mathematics 
to the endless possibilities of science and art. 

My hobbies âž½ playing musical instruments, solving puzzles and stargazing!

In my free time, I'm immersed in developing my Vulkan renderer in modern C++, unreal engine projects, 
exploring ray tracing, build an Arduino-based CPU and looking deeper into pure and applied mathematics (= studying),
audio programming with JUCE, among others.




While i have a multitude of projects in different areas i don't have anything available online, so if 
you want to talk about them ask me and i'll tell you everything!
I try to keep up with updating my repos and keeping them in good condition as much as i can! :>

# iPRISM Research group: Museum of Karditsa - Virutal Reality Museum  (2022 - present)

Collaborated with the Museum of Karditsa to create an interactive website 
for online visitors and enthusiasts about the exhibits of the 1821's Greek War of Independence. 
The project comprises three parts: a 2D website, a 3D web app version, 
and a database system used by a network of museums (as well as the websites)."

# iPRISM Research group: Port a Cath Training VR (2022 - 2023)

Developed and published a virtual reality simulator for the placement of port-a-cath devices 
in cancer patients by surgeons and medical assistants. The goal is to train medical personnel 
using VR technology to minimize medical errors and their negative impact on patients.

# B.Sc Thesis 'Development of an Augmented Reality System for Indoor Navigation Assistance' (2021)

My university thesis, titled 'Development of an Augmented Reality System for Indoor Navigation Assistance,' 
aimed to create a free, large-scale mobile AR map navigation system for all students to navigate 
the university without relying on internet beacons or triangulation. The system provides information 
about classes and the surrounding space, offers voice navigation, animations, QR repositioning, and more.


! Due to COVID-19 restriction rules, the application was scaled down to a smaller version: its functionalities and scope were reduced.

## Tech Stack
- [x] Unity game engine
- [x] C# programming language
- [x] AR Foundation Framework
- [x] A* search algorithm as a pathfinding algorithm for the navigation system
- [x] Custom QR reader for points of interest. (e.g reseting user position)
